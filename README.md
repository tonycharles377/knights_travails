# knights_travails
## Overview:
The Knights Travails is a Ruby project that aims to solve the classic Knight's Tour problem using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The problem involves finding a sequence of moves(shortest path) for a knight on an 8x8 chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once.

## Features:
* **BFS Algorithm**: Utilizes **Breadth-First Search** algorithm to systematically explore all possible knight moves from the starting position.
* **Efficient Solution**: Provides an efficient and systematic approach to finding a valid knight's tour on a chessboard.
* **Customizable Inputs**: Allows users to specify the starting and target positions on the chessboard.
* **Detailed Output**: Outputs the sequence of moves taken by the knight to reach the target position.
